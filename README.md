# Data Analyst Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects and tasks completed during my Data Analyst Internship. The focus of this work is on data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and basic statistical analysis using Python.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **SQL** (optional, depending on tasks)
- **Excel** (for comparison or light processing)

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets used in the analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing analysis and visualizations.
- `reports/`: Summary reports and findings from each project.

## 📊 Key Projects
1. **Sales Data Analysis** – Explored monthly sales trends, product performance, and regional breakdowns.
2. **Customer Segmentation** – Used demographic and purchase data to group customers.
3. **Survey Data Cleaning** – Cleaned and prepared survey data for analysis, removing nulls, standardizing formats, and transforming fields.

## 📈 Skills Demonstrated
- Data wrangling with pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
- Drawing business insights from data
- Communicating findings clearly and concisely

## 📌 Notes
All data used is either open-source or anonymized. This repository demonstrates my hands-on learning during the internship and the ability to apply Python to real-world data analysis scenarios.
